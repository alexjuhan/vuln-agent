# Web Application AI Security Agent

## Project Idea

LLM-powered code vulnerability triage

## Why

Today's security testing tools overwhelm developers with non-contextual alerts and false positives, making vulnerability management inefficient. As [MITRE](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/cwss_v1.0.1.html) notes, developers face thousands of bug reports without clear prioritization guidance. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/2-Introduction/) confirms this limitation - static analysis tools can't understand application context, requiring significant manual effort to validate findings. We're solving this by combining traditional security tools with LLM agents that can understand context, prioritize real threats, and provide actionable security insights via a centralized dashboard. 

About 50-80% of SAST findings are false positives. Our tool would reduce false positives by 40-60%, which translates to 15-20 hours per week for a security team of 5 people.

## What

A security dashboard powered by AI agents that:
- Prioritizes real vulnerabilities over false positives
- Provides context-aware security analysis
- Maps findings to CVE and OWASP data
- Uses vector databases to enable AI comprehension of your codebase
- Combines SAST and SCA with intelligent triage

## When

Throughout software development and QA

## Where

Flexible deployment options:
- Local environment via docker-compose
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- hosted service offering

## Who

Software developers, Product security teams, open source maintainers

## How

Implementation approach:
- Integrates open source security tools (CodeQL, semgrep, OWASP Dependency Check, npm audit, PyPi Safety)
- Vector database integration for codebase analysis
- AI agents process tool outputs for intelligent vulnerability triage
